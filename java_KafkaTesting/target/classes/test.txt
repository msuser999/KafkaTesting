These examples generate streaming DataFrames that are untyped, meaning that the schema of the DataFrame is not checked at compile time,
only checked at runtime when the query is submitted. Some operations like map, flatMap, etc. need the type to be known at compile time.
To do those, you can convert these untyped streaming DataFrames to typed streaming Datasets using the same
methods as static DataFrame. See the SQL Programming Guide for more details. Additionally, more 
details on the supported streaming sources are discussed later in the document.
